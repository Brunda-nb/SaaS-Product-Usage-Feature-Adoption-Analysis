# SaaS Product Usage & Feature Adoption Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes user behavior and feature adoption in a SaaS product to generate actionable insights for product improvement, retention strategies, and revenue optimization. It demonstrates end-to-end data analysis skills, dashboard creation, and alignment with **data observability principles**.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [SaaS Company Data Analysis] 
- **Contents:**
  - User IDs, signup dates, subscription types
  - Feature usage logs (frequency, duration)
  - Transactions / revenue data
  - Support interactions (optional)

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Data Extraction & Transformation:** SQL, Python (Pandas)
- **Visualization & Dashboard:** Tableau / Power BI
- **Automation / Pipeline (Optional):** Python scripts for periodic data cleaning and aggregation

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL)**
   - Handled missing or inconsistent data
   - Created key metrics: DAU, WAU, MAU, retention, churn, feature adoption rate
   - Aggregated monthly revenue and subscription upgrades

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Identified top features by usage frequency
   - Tracked user engagement across cohorts
   - Analyzed retention and churn trends

3. **Visualization**
   - Dashboard components:
     - **User Engagement:** DAU, WAU, MAU trends
     - **Feature Adoption:** Heatmaps of most/least used features
     - **Revenue Metrics:** ARR/MRR by cohort
     - **Retention & Churn:** Cohort retention curves

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Highlighted low-adoption features needing UX improvements
   - Identified high-value cohorts for upsell campaigns
   - Detected anomalies in usage trends for further investigation
   - Suggested strategies to improve trial-to-paid conversions

5. **Optional Automation Component**
   - Scheduled Python scripts to update dashboards automatically from raw logs
   - Simulated alerts for unusual spikes or drops in engagement metrics
